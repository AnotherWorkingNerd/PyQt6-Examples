## image browser code

These were continuing on my quest to learn PyQt6.

I was courious about the quality of the python code genenerated by Google Gemini. 
So I use a simple prompt that asked for PyQt6 code that would generate thumbnails
from images in a directory and show the fullsize image upon double click.

- `gemini_first_try.py` : This original code that was generated by google Gemini. 
I then fixed the the unworking code that was generated. The generated code had 
some really stupid mistakes too. Its 2024 and for all the hype this is the best
Gemini can do?!? 

- `giv.py` : of of the options on the gemini web page from this hamberger icon 
is "More Professional". this is the "More Professional" version of the code.

After using Gemini, Claude (from DuckDuckGo) and ChatGPT (4o), and using the same
prompt for all three. Its been my experience that ChatGPT actually generated
the better (not great, maybe not even good, but better) code of the three 
generative AI tools widely available: Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT. I haven't
added any code from Claude because it was really really bad. 
I see them now as just a tool to do some of the basic boiler plate code and 
us humans to do the "real work". Maybe in a few year things will be different.

- `imageBrowserWithThumbnails.py` - this is code that was converted from PyQt5 that I found on pythonguis.com fourm.
