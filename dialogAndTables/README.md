Dialog_test.py

I got a a little carried away with this. It started out as a simple app to show a 
dialog with a TableWidget in it. and morphed into...
- simple menu
- toolbar with icon buttons 
    - 4 active buttons that change a qlabel with a bad joke.
    - 1 checkbox that changes icon depending on state.
    - button that triggers dialogbox
- Dialog Box with button
    This has a table that shows builds a qss stylesheet from variables. 
    The style sheet changes the headers, and alternate row colors.

Thanks to svgrepo.com for the icons that are used in this example
