## PyQt6 Example code

This is a collection of of stuff that I gathered when I was learning PyQt6
and writing Cushy Viewer.

I was tired of finding stuff for the various Qt and PyQt6 variations and
I sure and heck wasn't going to install 3 or 4 variations of essentially
of the same thing or earlier versions. I generally learn by doing and
converting old code, some more than a decade old, to PyQt6 I'd learn in
the process. I've learned a lot in the process but by no means an SME or
even close to that. But maybe this code will help someone else.

I have tried to remember to include the source materiel URL but I sometimes forget.

I have no doubt some of this maybe all of this could be written better
but it served ***MY*** purposes yours is likely different. If you feel
the need to point a better way to code something, Great. Or an example I
don't have, even better. Send me a PR and if I like it I'll add it.
But only working, commented, os-agnostic PyQt6 code with no conditions, restrictions. I value
readability over conciseness for examples.

One other thing, I'm not Tech Support. This code is provided AS IS.
If the code doesn't work for you, sorry, you get what you pay for, Life's a B----.

All the code here is free to use or abuse however you see fit. Any pre-existing
owner copyrights MUST be observed.

Finally, there are a lot of older and likely better "offical" examples at [https://github.com/pyqt/examples/tree/_](https://github.com/pyqt/examples/tree/_)
however, many of these are PyQt5, etc.
