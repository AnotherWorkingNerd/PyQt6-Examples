## PyQt6 Example code

This is a collection of code that I used when I was learning PyQt6
and writing Cushy Viewer.

I was tired of finding stuff for the various Qt and PyQt6 variations 
when I was searching for answers to the meaning of ... and not knowing 
if an example from "pyqt", pyside, pyside *n*, or a previous version 
of PyQt would even work. Some of the example code I found was more than 
a decade old and I sure as heck wasn't going to install 3 or 4 variations 
of essentially of the same thing or some ancient versions that I'd never 
use again.

 I generally learn by doing and converting old code, some of it *REALLY* 
old. I've learned a lot by converting old code to PyQt6 but I am not even 
close to be being an SME. There seems to be a dirth of simple 
PyQT6 examples out there, sure there are a lot of PyQt5(or earlier), 
Pyside (in various versions), but even the Pyside6 stuff has some 
differences from PyQt6 aside from just the name and license type. 
In any case, maybe this code will help someone else figure out something.

I have tried to remember to include the original source materiel URL but 
I sometimes forget. For the ones I forgot... Sorry, I appreciate your 
time and code that helped me learn.

I have no doubt some of this maybe all of this could be written better 
but it served ***MY*** purposes, yours is likely different. Further 
this is for all intents and purposes just test code not production code.
Code that helped me understand something. If you feel
the need to point a better way to code something, Great. Or an example I
don't have, even better. Send me a PR. But I request only working, commented, 
os-agnostic PyQt6 code. I value readability over conciseness for examples.

One other thing, I'm not Tech Support. This code is provided AS IS.
If the code doesn't work for you, sorry, you get what you pay for.
