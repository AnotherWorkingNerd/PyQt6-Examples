## PyQt6 Example code

This is a collection of code that I used when I was learning PyQt6
and writing [LatentEye](https://github.com/AnotherWorkingNerd/LatentEye).

I grew weary of sifting through different Qt and PyQt6 variations  
while searching for answers about the meaning of \<insert feature or function here \>
I often found  myself unsure whether an example from "pyqt," pyside, pyside *n*, or  
an earlier version of PyQt would even be applicable. Some of the  
example code I encountered was over a decade old, and I definitely  
didn't want to install three or four variations of essentially the  
same framework, or outdated versions that I would never use again. 
So, I created this collection.

I generally learn by doing and converting old code, some of it *REALLY* 
old. I've learned a lot by converting old code to PyQt6, but I still 
feel like a noob. There seems to be a dearth of PyQt6 examples for the 
things I was looking for. Sure, there are many for PyQt5 (or earlier) 
and various versions of Pyside, but even the Pyside6 examples have 
differences from PyQt6 beyond just the name and license type. In any 
case, I hope these examples help someone else figure something out.

Some of these I wrote, some I modified, some I just changed the import lines
and some I did write any of it. I have tried to remember to include the original 
source materiel URL but I sometimes forget. For the ones I forgot... 
Sorry, Thank you for making it publicly available. I appreciate your time and
code that helped me learn this stuff.

I have no doubt some of this maybe all of this could be written better 
but it served ***MY*** purposes, yours is likely different. Further 
this is for all intents and purposes just test code not production code.
--- code that helped me understand something. If you feel
the need to point a better way to code something, Great. Or an example I
don't have, even better. Send me a PR. But I request only working, commented, 
os-agnostic PyQt6 code. I value readability over conciseness for examples.

One other thing, I'm not Tech Support. This code is provided AS IS.
If the code doesn't work for you, sorry, you get what you pay for.

All the code here is free to use or abuse however you see fit. Any pre-existing
owner copyrights MUST be observed.

Finally, there are a lot of older and likely better "offical" examples at [https://github.com/pyqt/examples/tree/_](https://github.com/pyqt/examples/tree/_)

however, many of these are PyQt5, etc.

There are a few other good examples at:
- [https://github.com/pythonguis/pythonguis-examples](https://github.com/pythonguis/pythonguis-examples)
- [https://www.pythonguis.com](https://www.pythonguis.com)
I'm sure if you use your favorite search engine you will find others.
